Slides from a short talk at the [Berlin AppSec & Crypto Meetup](https://berlinsec.github.io/),
a continuation of Hanno BÃ¶ck's talk about [TLS version intolerance](https://www.int21.de/slides/berlinsec-versionintolerance/)
from a month before. He explained how with TLS 1.3 just around the corner there
again are growing compatibility concerns about legacy TLS stacks. I covered
the latest TLS WG developments around version negotiation for TLS 1.3 and
[GREASE](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-davidben-tls-grease-01).
