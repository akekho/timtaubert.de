Today marks the beginning of my fourth year at Mozilla. It has been an amazing
three years and the best job I could hope for. Since March I am now in the
position of an Engineering Manager with a few highly intelligent and great
people that I am very grateful to call my team.

I am super excited about all the personal and professional challenges I will
be facing this year. It is my core belief that it is all about growth and for
that Mozilla is exactly the right place to be.
