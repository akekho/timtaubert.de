I live in Berlin, Germany. I spend most of my time coding, reading
books about coding, making music or riding my motorbike.

I love JavaScript and Linux. I post things on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ttaubert).
My code usually goes on [GitHub](https://github.com/ttaubert).
My Keybase ID is [ttaubert](https://keybase.io/ttaubert).
I'm on [XING](https://www.xing.com/profile/Tim_Taubert) and
[LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/tim-taubert/43/368/703) but can't promise
to keep those profiles up-to-date.

In 2011 I joined Mozilla in the fight for an open web.
