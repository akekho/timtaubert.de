Hi, my name is Tim Taubert.

I am an Engineering Manager and Senior Engineer working for Mozilla, living in Berlin.
I spend most of my time coding, reading books, or riding (motor) bikes.

I post things on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ttaubert),
my code goes on [GitHub](https://github.com/ttaubert),
my Keybase ID is [ttaubert](https://keybase.io/ttaubert).  
I'm on [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/tim-taubert/43/368/703)
but do not promise to keep that profile up-to-date.

(Germany unfortunately requires me to have an [imprint](/imprint).)

You can also contact me via [email](mailto:tim@timtaubert.de).
